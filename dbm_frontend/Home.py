            E-DataSync is an innovative E-commerce inventory management system designed
            to enhance communication and interaction between database
            managers and end users across distributed databases. 
            The system focuses on three crucial relational tables: products, suppliers, and orders.
            The initial implementation involves data for the products table, and we are actively
            working on generating synthetic datasets for suppliers and orders tables, ensuring
            a comprehensive inventory management solution.
