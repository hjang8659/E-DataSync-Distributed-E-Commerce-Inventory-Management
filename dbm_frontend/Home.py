        E-DataSync is an innovative E-commerce inventory management system designed
        to enhance communication and interaction between database
        managers and end users across distributed databases. 
        The system focuses on three crucial relational tables: products, suppliers, and orders.
        The initial implementation involves data for the products table, and we are actively
        working on generating synthetic datasets for suppliers and orders tables, ensuring
        a comprehensive inventory management solution.
